                1. Install Metamask (this can either be with a browser extension or through mobile app): https://www.coindesk.com/learn/how-to-set-up-a-metamask-wallet/ <br><br>
                2. In order to interact with this site on mobile you’ll need to hit this URL through the app OR via the browser that has Metamask installed <br><br>
                3. Purchase 31 MATIC (if you don’t have an account at an exchange get in contact with me and we can do an exchange via Paypal) — The extra 1 MATIC is for gas fees, basically the cost to use the blockchain. <br><br>
                4. Transfer the MATIC to your wallet address (this can be found under your Account name, which is likely ‘Account 1’)<br><br>
                5. You’ll now need to add the Polygon network (MATIC is the coin for the network). Click on ‘Ethereum Mainnet’ and press ‘Add Network’. Enter the details below:
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                  <li><b>Name:</b> Polygon</li>
                  <li><b>New RPC URL (Choose one of the following):</b> https://polygon-rpc.com</li>
                  <li><b>ChainID:</b> 137</li>
                  <li><b>Symbol:</b> MATIC</li>
                  <li><b>Explorer URL:</b> https://polygonscan.com</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                6. Hard part done! You’ll see the ‘Buy-in’ button next to your name, click on that.<br><br>
                7. A message will pop up asking you to sign a transaction, sign that and once the transaction is settled on the blockchain you’ll get a pop-up. If you’re on mobile or have ad blockers you probably won’t get it, simply hit refresh after 30 seconds or so. If the ‘buy-in’ button is no longer by your name, you’re all set!

                  The new Queen/King has been crowned! What to do next?<br><br>

                  1. Hit the ‘Get League Winner’ button. This will interact with the Smart Contract to get the winning team (which has their address/wallet tied to the name)<br><br>
                  2. Once that transaction has settled, there will need to be THREE people to confirm that they are indeed the winner (to prevent fraud). The three people MUST be addresses/wallets that bought in and can include the person that won.<br><br>
                  3. Once at least 3 people have confirmed the winner, the Champ can hit the ‘Claim Winnings’ button and they’ll get the pot of MATIC sent straight to their wallet!<br><br><br>

                  Side (technical) note: The 'Get League Winner' button uses an Oracle (Chainlink) to hit the Premier League API which grabs the winner. This costs LINK (0.1 per request). <br> As there is limited LINK in the contract please only hit this button at the end of season.<br>
                  It also resets the count of people who have verified the winner to zero.
